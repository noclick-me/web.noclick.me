These log files contains usage data like your device’s Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our website that you visit and the time and date of your visit. This data is only used for maintenance purposes and to generate anonymous access statistics to make sure the service is running smoothly.

<p>These logs are not kept longer than one year and when possible IP addresses will be anonymized even before that.</p>
<p>When using the <strong>noclick.me app</strong>, <strong>web app</strong> or <strong>web API</strong> to expand an URL, this URL will be transferred and stored in our servers for an undetermined amount of time. The servers will then access that URL and retrieve its contents, and save some of them too. These contents will be available in a slightly modified way in the expanded URL produced by this service. These contents are publicly available through the originally submitted URL are not analyzed for personal data of any kind, this data is not associated to any individual, is only stored opaquely and sent as is.</p>
